/*
  Esplora Wireless Slave

  This sketch allows to test all the Esplora's peripherals over an Xbee connected to the hardware serial (Serial1).
  It also outputs button and joystick state like a game  controller (rudimentary)
  
  When uploaded, you can open a PuTTY Serial monitor and write one of
  the following commands (without quotes) to get an answer:
  
  "D": prints the current value of all sensors, separated by a comma.
       See the dumpInputs() function below to get the meaning of
       each value.
       
  "Rxxx"
  "Gxxx"
  "Bxxx": set the color of the RGB led. For example, write "R255"
          to turn on the red to full brightness, "G128" to turn
          the green to half brightness, or "G0" to turn off
          the green channel.
  
  "Txxxx": play a tone with the buzzer. The number is the
           frequency, e.g. "T440" plays the central A note.
           Write "T0" to turn off the buzzer.

  You're going to handle eight different buttons. You'll use arrays, 
  which are ordered lists of variables with a fixed size. Each array 
  has an index (counting from 0) to keep track of the position
  you're reading in the array, and each position can contain a number.
 
  This code uses three different arrays: one for the buttons you'll read;
  a second to hold the current states of those buttons; and a third to hold
  the keystrokes associated with each button.
 */

  This array holds the last sensed state of each of the buttons
  you're reading.
  Later in the code, you'll read the button states, and compare them
  to the previous states that are stored in this array. If the two
  states are different, it means that the button was either
  pressed or released.

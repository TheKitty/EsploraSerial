  Esplora Software serial test
 
 Receives from the hardware serial, sends to software serial.
 Receives from software serial, sends to hardware serial.
 
 The circuit: 
 * RX is digital pin 8 (connect to TX of other device) (must be pins 8,9,10,11,14,15,16 for soft on Leos)
 * TX is digital pin 1 (connect to RX of other device)
 
 Not all pins on the Leonardo type Arduinos support change interrupts, 
 so only the following can be used for RX: 
 8, 9, 10, 11, 14 (MISO), 15 (SCK), 16 (MOSI).
 
 Softserial example created back in the mists of time
 Based on Arduino SoftSerialExample by Tom Igoe
 which was based on Mikal Hart's example
